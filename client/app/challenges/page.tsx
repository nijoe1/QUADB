        <p>
          This is a WIP feature that it is going to make dataset curators to
          stake on their provided data
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Data Cosumers are going to be able to verify the validity and the
          maintenance of the datasets using a deterministic a UX friendly way
        </p>
        <p>
          If someone finds an incocistency in the data, they can start a
          chalenge which is going to be a the dispute resolution process As long
          as a lot of consumers are going to be able to verify the data, the
          challenge is going to be resolved. The challenge is going to be a
          Prediction Market as long as the data flaws are verifiable then that
          is going to be a way to make money but as the verification process is
          going to be robust then Prediction Market manipulators are going to
          lose money. We scope to offer a way to check high margin Challenges
          dashboard so that Curtors are going to be incentivized to act
          correctly otherwise they get penalized
